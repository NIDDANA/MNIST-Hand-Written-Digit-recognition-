# MNIST-Hand-Written-Digit-recognition-
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build and train a machine learning model capable of accurately recognizing handwritten digits. The project covers the following steps:

Data Preprocessing
Model Building
Model Training and Evaluation
Predictions on New Data
Features
